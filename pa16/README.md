# pa16
This program is a programming assignment that demonstrates class concepts learned in Chapter 16 through the use of the Vector class to provide a wide range of use cases.

Notable features include:
  - proper code documentation
  - proper implementation of Makefiles
  - iterators
  - sorting algorithms (ie. bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and std::sort)
  - searching algorithms (ie. sequential sort & binary sort)
  - pointers
  - vectors
  - structs
  - no memory leaks
  - selection statements
  - selection sort algorithm
  - and an appropriate output based on the validity of the program's operation.

## Getting Started

Clone/download the files and any dependencies for your project then compile and run the programs using the linux command:
  - "$ make

### Prerequisites

In order to run any C++ based programs you must first have installed C++ and its dependencies on a device that can compile
and run the program.  You can install the appropriate software many ways:
1. Visual Studio
2. Geany
3. Repository: Most if not all linux distros have a repository containing the necessary software that can be accessed using the
   below example commands (more information can be found by accessing the manual/help page for your operating system):
   - For Debian/GNU Linux:
         - "$ sudo apt install build-essential"
   - RHEL
         - "$ sudo dnf install build-essential"

Occasionally programs may require dependencies; the easiest way to properly install them is by searching GitHub repositories
and cloning/downloading the appropriate files for your project.  This can be done in:
    - a web browser
    - **or**
    - through the "git clone ssh://git@github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git" command
Once downloaded, import the library and restart your IDE.

### Example installation
1. Download the appropriate dependencies and software
2. Install as needed
3. Import any libraries/dependencies for your project (most projects will state this in the first few lines)
4. Clone the files from the repository
5. Upload the code to your device (laptop, Desktop, etc.).
6. Contribute to further developments.
7. Repeat as needed
