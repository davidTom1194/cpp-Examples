# @brief This makefile is designed to easily compile any dependencies alongside
#        the main file in order to apply any changes required for submission.
#
# @note People who helped me: N/A
#
# @note This is but one possible solution to the assignment.
#       Programming techniques and commands in this solution
#       are aligned with the current and previous chapters,
#       labs, and lectures, which may result in a trade-off
#       between efficient coding and what student are
#       currently able to understand.
